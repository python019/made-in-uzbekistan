Hey there! Are you interested in being a moderator of this repo and ensure the quality and authenticity of projects and repos added here?

It is required for us to monitor and review projects added to the repo in order not to dilute it's quality.

## Responsibilities

* Go through projects currently added to the repo, clean up to ensure each one match the requirements in the **contributing.md** file. If they don't, remove and submit a PR so I can validate and merge.
* Review all Pull requests to ensure they match the requirements stated in the contributing.md file. The ones that match should be approved and I'll merge :) Otherwise, comments can be provided to inform the contributor of what went wrong or needs to be done.

* Free to make suggestions and improvements as well.

* Constant availability.


## Requirements
